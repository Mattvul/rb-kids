# RB Kids Policies and Procedures

## General Information

RB kids is the Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers Child Care Program. This program was developed as part of
Ritchie Bros. relocation to its beautiful new Burnaby headquarters in the summer of 2009. We provide
very high quality early learning and child care experiences for all the children and families who
participate in our program.

We are a combined philosophy (Montessori, Reggio & ECE-Guided by the principles of the Early Learning
Frame Work) Corporate child care facility. Our state of the art facility and care team offer a child
centered, nurturing environment for infants, toddlers, preschoolers and school age children.

The program is responsive to the individual needs of the children and families that it serves. Qualified,
experienced educators ensure that physical, emotional and social development of each child is
supported through the provision of an environment that truly respects the needs of young children.

### RB Kids

* Recognizes the importance of the early years
* Offers the best of the best in early learning and care

* Supports early learning through play, creative exploration and enhanced educational
  opportunities.

### Our team

All Staff at RB Kids have Early Childhood Education certification (or are currently enrolled in training) and
experience in the early learning and care field. Additionally, many members also have Infant-Toddler,
Special Needs or Montessori certification. They meet requirements outlined in the Child Care Facility
Licensing Regulations, including having first aid certification and current criminal record clearance. Our
staffs are encouraged to continue their professional development and to be members of professional
organizations, such as Early Childhood Educators of BC, the BC Montessori Association and other

community of colleagues and a wealth of informational and research in the field.

As a program that is committed to high quality care and learning experiences, we close for three
professional development days per year. In addition, we have an annual closure for the last three
business days of June to conduct facility maintenance and a Strategic Planning & In-Depth Professional
Development Retreat. Closure dates will be emailed out January of each year.

## Section One

### About Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers Child Care Program

Welcome to the Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers Child Care Program. This program is operated as part of the company and serves
employee children on a priority basis. We also welcome non-RBA children on a full time basis as space permits. Our vision is to
provide very high quality early learning and child care experiences for all the children and families who enroll.

### Child Care Programs Offered

The RBA Child Care offers both full and part time (minimum of 2 consecutive days per week for example; Monday/Tuesday or
Thursday/Friday). Please note we do not offer mid-week spaces. We provide child care for infants, toddlers and children ages
30 months to school entry. On a space permitting basis, we are able to offer back up care to children age 3 months to 12
years

We offer four classrooms that are licensed as follows:

* Group Child Care – Under 36 months – 12 spaces
* Group Child Care – Under 36 months – 12 spaces
* Group Child Care – Under 36 months – 10 spaces
* Group Child Care – 30 months to school entry – 25 spaces
* Group Child Care – Multi-age - 8 spaces

### Outdoor Learning Program

Studies have shown that when children are offered free play opportunities outdoors (without play structures), they are better able
to self-regulate themselves, and have better spatial awareness. The ability to participate in a natural outdoor setting is important
to the development of children in all areas; physically, socially, emotionally, and cognitively. Combining Reggio with nature is a
powerful, engaging, fun learning opportunity. We empower our children to be creative thinkers and problem solvers when we
enable them to take risks. The development of outdoor programming is innovative and creative.

### Music Program

Being exposed to music in the early years stimulates children’s brain development. We provide a joyful, hands on and fun music
time for our children to further develop their social, emotional, cognitive and language skills.
We offer the following in our Music Program:

* Music & Movement
* Group Piano for 3 – 5-year old’s
* Music Appreciation – Guests come in and showcase their musical talents (e.g. guitar, violin, drums & Chinese flute)

### Harmony Kids Yoga Program

Offers children of all ages the gifts of lower stress, anger management, increased self-esteem, lowered anxiety, improved
concentration and focus, self-awareness and confidence. Come laugh, dance and play as we celebrate all that is magical about
Yoga & mindfulness.

### Program Philosophy

At the RBA Child Care, we are committed to creating a safe, warm, inviting and nurturing environment where young children
develop, and learn in a way that best supports their individual needs. Our program is a happy, joyful place that truly celebrates
and respects young children. We have designed our facility space to ensure we can offer the best possible program for young
children.

At the RBA Child Care Program, we:

#### Recognize the Importance of the Early Years

Children who are exposed to high quality early learning and care experiences during this time are better prepared for
school entry and their subsequent success later in life. The RBA Child Care Program has been designed in a way that
ensures the level of quality provided through the program is considered to be a priority.

#### Offer the Best of the Best in Learning and Care

Our program combines the best elements from multiple educational philosophies (Reggio Emilia, Montessori and
Traditional Early Learning) to deliver a program that offers the best possible experiences for all the children who are
enrolled. One of our guiding principles of the program is to ensure that we are working with the children in a way that
truly respects and follows the needs of each individual child.

#### Encourage Independence from the Beginning

Children are guided in achieving independence from early on as this supports the development of a strong sense of
self-esteem, confidence and belief in self. Our selections of furnishings for the program are a true example of how we
support and encourage this. All the classrooms are equipped with materials, shelves, tables, chairs and play areas
that are fully accessible and child friendly. We encourage safe exploration, learning, joy and fun in all of our child sized
environments. Our outdoor play area has been custom designed to meet the needs of the program.

#### Share, Care, Communicate and Celebrate Diversity

Our teachers show children how to be a good role model by being positive role models themselves. We learn about the
importance of caring, compassion, empathy, respect and self-discipline through a thoroughly integrated virtues
program that is active in all levels of our program. Conflict resolution is encouraged through the ongoing development
of communication skills, problem solving and firm, fair and consistent discipline that is age appropriate. We celebrate
diversity by incorporating a range of cultural experiences, music and celebrations into our program offerings.

#### Early Learning through Play, Creative Exploration and Enhanced Educational Opportunities

Play is of paramount importance in helping young children to develop the important skills related to communication,
self-direction, early learning, problem solving, and literacy; all of which lead children toward school readiness. Our program supports creative exploration and a wide range of early learning opportunities. The RBA early learning
curriculum encompasses wellbeing-and belonging, exploration and creativity, languages and literacy (both number and letter), social responsibility and diversity. We also ensure that children develop a sense of the world around them by incorporating a range of music, visual arts, culture, geography and community/environmental awareness activities into
the daily, weekly and monthly programming.

### About Our Teaching and Care Team

All staff at the RBA Child Care have Early Childhood Education training and experience in the child care and early learning
field. They meet all requirements outlined in the Child Care Facility Licensing Regulations, including having a first aid certificate
and current criminal record check.

Our staff are encouraged to continue in professional development and to be members of professional organizations, such as the
Early Childhood Educators of BC, the BC Montessori Association and other relevant associations in the field of early learning
and care. These opportunities connect our team with a community of colleagues and a wealth of information and research in the
field.

The Centre is managed by the Corporate Child Care Director of Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers. The Centre Director can be reached
via telephone at 778-331-5532. In addition, there is a Program Supervisor who manages the program when the Director is
absent or unavailable. Collectively, the teaching team is responsible for delivery of the child care program in accordance with the
overall program philosophy.

### Other People You May Meet in Our Classrooms

#### Visitors and Volunteers

On occasion, we have visitors in our classrooms who wish to volunteer their time in our program or who may come to make a
special presentation to the children. All our visitors are pre-screened prior to being invited to work alongside the teaching staff to
ensure the children have the most positive and supportive experience that we can provide. All volunteers must have a complete
criminal record check prior to being admitted to the classrooms. It is our policy that an RBA staff member will always be present
with the children; they will never be left unattended or allowed to leave the classroom or the premises with a visitor.

#### Practicum Students

Throughout the year we may host practicum students who are doing their ECE or Montessori teacher training through a local
University or College. These students are in our programs to be mentored by our staff as well as to gain experience in the
field. Sometimes they will simply come to observe in the classrooms for a day or two and other times they may stay for several
weeks in order to gain practical experience. All practicum students must have a complete criminal record check prior to being
admitted to the classrooms

#### Professionals

There are a variety of professionals connected with the field of early childhood education who may occasionally visit our centre
for the purpose of observations, inspections &/or presentations. Some of the people you may encounter are the Government
Licensing Officer, Government Health Inspectors or Specialists, local university and college instructors as well as specialty
instructors that will enhance your child’s experience in a specific learning area (artists, musicians, community helpers, etc…) We
also host tours of the program to other area businesses who may be considering developing their own child care facility

## Section Two

### Enrolling in the Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers Child Care Program

### Program Enrollment Procedure – RBA Employees

All families who are interested in enrolling in the child care program will receive an enrollment package **(depending on the
desired start date)** which must be completed and submitted to the Director prior to the child commencing the program. Below
are the steps regarding this process.

1. Initial parent inquiry is received by the centre. The parent is sent a pre-registration form and then is invited to visit the
   centre for a tour and to meet with the centre Director or classroom Supervisor. Parent receives enrollment package.
2. Parent completes and returns the following items to the centre: (Depending on actual start date): **Enrollment Form**, **Planned Attendance Schedule**
3. Additional Consents
4. Enrollment Agreement
5. Deposit equal to first month’s fees (The deposit is required to reserve your space- but does not
   guarantee that a space will be open on your requested start date. We match it as close as possible
   with the next available space.)
6. 12 postdated cheques – the first cheque should be dated for the first month that the child is commencing the
   program.
7. Supply fee cheque – pro-rated according to schedule
8. The forms are reviewed and the Director confirms enrollment in the program.
9. A gradual entry schedule is discussed and agreed upon to assist you child(ren) in transitioning into the
   program.

#### Gradual Entry

Adjusting to a new environment can be both exciting and stressful for parents and children. Developing a gradual entry plan can
help you and your child feel secure in their new environment.
**The length of gradual entry may vary according to the family and child needs. This can be decided between the family
and Program Supervisor/Director.**

Parents and the staff can work out a gradual entry that fits the family’s schedule. For all children a few visits to the centre with
parents will assist with the building of trust, security and relationships with program staff. We then recommend a couple of short
stays without the parents.

Below is an example of what a gradual entry schedule might look like **(each step could last between 1-5 days; depending
upon the child)**:
Step 1 - One Parent stay s with the child for 30 mins – Time to be determined by the Program Supervisor or Director based on the program
Step 2 - Parents drop child off and leave child in program for approximately 2 hours (Parents remain on site in the Café)
Step 3 - Parents drop child off and leave child in program until approx. 11:00 am(Parents remain on site in the Café)
Step 4 - repeat of step 3 if needed and at any time the gradual entry can be adjusted.

### Program Enrollment Procedure – Community

A complete fee schedule is included in the Enrollment package. Daily fees apply to children who attend the program on a backup or school closure basis as space permits.

Fees are **due and payable on the 1st of every month**. Payments are required in the form of postdated cheques. All cheques
are to be made payable to “Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers”. Cheques are deposited on or after the 15th of each month.

The RBA Child Care Program welcomes children who qualify for subsidy from the Provincial Government. Families are
responsible for ensuring that their subsidy authorizations are kept up to date. Fees are considered still owing from the family
until RBA Child Care has received subsidy authorization. Parents are responsible to make up any difference between the
subsidy level and the actual child care fee.

Families who are unable to pay their fees on the first of the month are requested to contact the RBA Director immediately to
make alternate arrangements; which may be documented in writing.

#### Withdrawal from the Child Care Program

Families who wish to withdraw from the child care program must follow the Withdrawal Procedure as outlined in the Enrollment
Agreement which states:

Written notice of a child’s withdrawal from the Facility must be received one month prior to the intended date of withdrawal and
must be dated and received by the Facility PRIOR to the first day of the month. Provided that written notice is received one
month prior to withdrawal and is dated and received by the Facility PRIOR to the first day of the month the Facility will apply the
last month’s prepaid Deposit toward the last month’s fee for the last month of attendance. If withdrawal notice is not received according to this procedure, the current month’s tuition will be payable in full and the pre-paid Deposit WILL NOT be refunded

### Daily Class Schedules

be set up in a quiet area for the children (or a nap room for infants-toddlers). A small cuddly from home can be brought for
children for nap time if needed.

#### Birthday Celebrations

Children love to celebrate birthdays and special occasions with their friends. At RBA Child Care, we will host a special birthday
ceremony in which we tell the class the story of the birthday child’s life. In order for you to assist in the creation of this special
ceremony please send in a photograph of your child at each year of his life. A special birthday snack such as small muffins, mini
pizzas, fruit trays, etc. can also be brought in, but are not necessary. **Please don’t send sugary treats for birthday
celebrations. All birthday food must adhere to the allergy policy of the child care. If birthday snacks are homemade they
must include a written list of ingredients. Any fruits/vegetable should come whole not pre-cut.**

If you are handing out birthday party invitations we encourage parents and children to place them in the children’s cubbies.
Please avoid handing them out in the classroom as they often get left behind or can be a source of stress for children who may
not be part of your planned celebration.

#### Holidays and Other Cultural Celebrations

At the Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers Child Care Program, we recognize a wide range of traditional holidays and cultural
celebrations. Please inform your child’s teachers if you plan to keep children home to observe family religious or ethnic
celebrations; should it occur on a day that the facility is normally in operation.

As the majority of children are in our program for long periods of time during the day we generally celebrate these events using a
more low-key type of format. This ensures the children don’t become over-excited or stressed by the various holiday
celebrations.

As a child care, we also celebrate International Week. This allows all of our children to learn more about various cultures around
the world. Watch for special information notices to be sent home regarding this week. Family support and participation in this
week is very much appreciated.

In consultation with a licensed dietician and in collaboration with the Chef Manager of the Kelowna Café we offer a healthy
breakfast, lunch and snack program. We follow the recommendations set out by the Canada Food Guide for young children.
Please contact the program manager for information and registration. Please note this is not included in your child care fees.

#### Open Snack

At RBA Child Care, we provide nutritious snacks each day through an Open Snack Program for our older Toddlers, 3-5 and
Multi-Age children. We ask that each child contribute a fruit or vegetable to our snack basket daily. These baskets can be found
at the entry way to the classrooms; just by the sign in sheets. (Examples of items for the baskets include – an apple, an orange,
a cucumber, a carrot etc. Please only send whole fruits or vegetables). The teachers will prepare these items and place them onto a snack plate which will be shared with the children. Snack is available to the children throughout the day and children are
encouraged to serve themselves when they are hungry.

#### Lunch

Lunch is a very important part of your child’s day. We include the following in our menu each day. For parents bringing their child
food we ask and encourage healthy, nutritious, easily manageable lunches for your child. Some foods choices to consider when
preparing lunch for your child include.

* Vegetables and fruit
* Grain products
* Milk and alternatives
* Meat and alternatives

Unfortunately, due to health regulations we cannot heat up lunches so please put items that you wish to be warm in a thermos
container. We strive to keep our program a low sugar; healthy environment so would prefer that you don’t send items
such as cake, cookies, candy, soda pop, and fruit punch etc. Infants and Toddlers should bring formula or milk that is
already prepared and in labeled bottles or cup.

**Please keep in mind the following food preparation suggestions while planning your child’s meals:**
To avoid choking hazards please cut:

* wieners/sausages length wise and chop into small bite size pieces.
* vegetables into small bite size pieces
* grapes length wise
  Infant/Toddlers:
* Bottles will not be used 2 hours after heating due to health reasons
* Vegetables need to be steamed/cooked not raw.
* Fruit needs to be peeled and cut into small bite sized pieces.
* In addition, the Canada Food Safety Guide recommends children under the age of one do not have honey, eggs, nuts
  or raisins.

### Allergies and Food Tolerance

#### Due to the severity of some nut allergies RBA Child Care is a NUT FREE ZONE.

Please do not send any items that contain nuts or that are made in facilities where they may come into contact with nuts.

Please notify staff of any specific dietary restrictions, allergies and/or food preferences in addition to any intolerance’s related to
your cultural background, in order for us to arrange the appropriate snack and general food safety

### Toys from Home & Show and Tell

Each program will on occasion have a show and tell day that allows children to bring items they would like to share with their
classmates. We encourage children to bring an item from nature, something they have made, a special souvenir from a trip, or
their favourite nonfiction book. The bringing of toys is discouraged as they often get lost or broken.

### Lost and Found

Items that are unclaimed or lost will be listed or placed by the entrance to the classroom. Any unclaimed items at the end of the
month will go to charity.

### Arrival and Drop Off

Our centre opens at 7:30 am. We encourage all full time and half day morning children to arrive to the program by 9:00 am so
they receive the full benefit of the daily program offerings. Children registered in the half day afternoon program are encouraged
to arrive by 1:00pm. This will be of particular importance to children in the 3 – 5-year-old program.
Upon arrival to the centre please remember to sign your child in, ensure that a staff member has acknowledged the arrival of
your child as well as inform staff members of any particular concerns, needs or already known injuries that your child may have
on that particular day.

If your child will be late or absent please contact the centre at 778-331-5532. This will assure us that you and your child are safe
and therefore will not worry about your whereabouts.

#### Greetings & Goodbyes

The transition from home into the classroom is an important part of the day. Greeting the teacher is one of the key transitions of
the day for your child. In order to make this process as smooth as possible, we encourage parents to say any special good-byes
before the child meets their teacher. This enables children to build independence and to also enter the classroom
confidently. When children are leaving at the end of the day, please ensure they have an opportunity to personally say goodbye
to their teacher.

**Infants & Toddlers** - Initially, it can be difficult for parents and young children to separate. Our teachers have many years of
experience supporting children who experience separation anxiety. Please feel free to call the child care for reassurance that
your child has settled in and is adjusting well.

#### Encouraging Child Independence

Supporting and encouraging child independence is an important part of our program. Wherever possible, please allow your child
to get themselves ready when they arrive at our program or when they are preparing to go home. Even many of our youngest
children can put on/take off their own slippers and jackets. (Obviously for our infants they will need the most parent and teacher
support; however, we still like to encourage their help as much as possible!) Your patience and encouragement in this area will
support your child in this process. If you think that you will be rushing at the end of the day, feel free to call the centre in
advance of your arrival so that we can allow your child the extra time they need to get ready themselves as much as possible.

Please support your child’s independence by choosing clothing that is easy for them to manage themselves. (No buckles,
buttons etc that are very challenging etc). Lunches for toddlers and older children should be packaged in containers that are
easy for a child to open themselves.

At the RBA Child Care Program, we guide children how to use the toilets and sinks in an age appropriate manner starting in our
infant-toddler program. We follow each child’s developmental needs with regard to toilet learning. For young children (under
three) who are learning how to use the toilet the teachers will assist them through encouragement and actual physical support
(hand over hand guided wiping of the bottom if needed, support with hand washing etc.) For older children (three years of age
and up) our policy is to support children with toileting and hand washing through verbal support and encouragement only. If you
have questions regarding this please speak to your child’s teacher.

#### Departure and Pick Up

**RBA child care closes at 5:30 pm daily.**

While preparing your child to leave the centre for the day please remember to sign your child out, make sure a staff member is
aware that your child is being picked up as well as take home all necessary belongings/art/bedding from your child’s cubby.

Staff will be there to communicate any necessary information and to tell you about your child’s day. If you have any questions
please ask the staff and they will be more than happy to be of assistance. If you require a more in depth discussion please feel
free to contact the centre by phone or email to arrange a time for a parent/teacher conference.

#### Late Pick Up Procedure & Late Fees

If you know you will be arriving late, we would appreciate a courtesy call in order to provide comfort and re-assurance to your
child that you are on your way. A call will also assist with making the necessary staffing arrangements.

**Parents/Guardians who are arrive late to pick up their child, whether the centre has been notified or not, will be charged
a late fee commencing at 5:35 pm at a rate of $1.00 per minute. Late fees will be invoiced on a periodic basis by the child
care.**

If RBA Child Care has not heard from you by 5:35pm the procedure is as follows:

1. Staff member will phone your home or place of employment; if there is no answer or you cannot be contacted, the alternate person on you registration form will be called.
2. If no one is available and no alternate arrangements have been made then at 6:00pm we are obligated by
   our Licensing requirements to contact the Ministry of Child and Family Development. They will pick up your
   child and provide care for them. To learn where they have placed your child you will need to contact the
   Ministry’s After-Hours Emergency Number at 604-660-8180.
3. Late charges will apply as stated above.

#### Persons Authorized to Pick Up Your Child

When enrolling a child in RBA Child Care the parent/guardian are asked to list by name on the registration form any person(s)
who have permission to pick up your child. Please keep staff informed of any changes to this list. Any person(s) not named on
this form by the parent/guardian will NOT be allowed to take the child from the program. Program staff must receive written,
email or verbal permission, which includes person(s) full name, from the parent/guardian. This information will then be
documented in the staff communication book for that specific day. Picture ID and/or a password will be requested.

If an adult not authorized to pick up a child arrives to the centre, the staff will immediately contact the parent/guardian, to get
verbal approval for this person(s) to pick up the child. If person(s) is verbally authorized to pick up the child, staff will confirm this person’s identity prior to releasing the child to their care. If person(s) are unauthorized staff will wait for the parent/guardian to personally come and pick up the child.

#### If a Parent or Authorized Pick Up is Unable to Provide Safe Care of a Child

If a staff member assesses a parent/guardian as incapable of providing safe care to their child at the time of pick up, staff will
proceed as follows:

1. Parents/Guardians will be asked and/or offered assistance in making alternate arrangements.
2. Staff will offer to call a cab/taxi.
3. If these offers are refused and the parent/guardian insists on taking the child, the staff member will inform the
   parent/guardian that they (the staff member) have an obligation to contact either the Police and/or the Ministry for
   Children and Family Development.

#### Custody and Related Court Orders

If there are custody orders in place, we require that the parent provides the child care centre with a copy to be kept on file.
Parents cannot be denied access to their child unless a court order is provided for the centre to keep on file.

If a person that has been specifically stated on the child’s registration form not authorized to pick the child up, arrives to pick up a child, then the staff will immediately contact the authorized person on the child’s file, to have them come and pick up the
child. The staff will not release a child to a specifically identified, non-authorized person.

## Section Six

further clarification is required, parents are encouraged to contact the child care office and speak with the Program Supervisor or
Director, Corporate Child Care Services.

Formal complaints regarding issues related to your child or the child care program should be submitted in writing to the Director,
Corporate Child Care Services.

#### Communication with Second Families

Whenever parents are separated, divorced, or for some other reason not living at the same address, we want to keep both
parents informed of their child’s progress and child care matters.

* When parent-teacher conferences are scheduled, the teachers should not be asked to conduct separate conferences
  for each parent. We need to communicate the same thing to both parents at the same time, as this experience can
  never be exactly duplicated. If either parent is uncomfortable with scheduling joint conferences, he or she should
  contact the Child Care Director or to discuss the situation.
* Both parents are equally welcomed at all child care events.
* Free and open communication among all parties is encouraged so that everyone is fully informed.

### Parent-Teacher Conferences

It is very important for teachers and parents to establish and maintain close communication. Please feel free to ask questions or
discuss anything related to your child’s progress. We ask, however, that you understand that the **teacher’s responsibility
during child care hours is to the child**. Morning arrival in particular is a very sensitive period when the teachers are greeting
each child and setting a calm, pleasant tone for the day.

**RBA Child Care schedules parent teacher conferences on an as required basis**. If you would like to set up a time to meet
with your child’s teachers please let us know.

#### Attendance and Absentees

All parents /guardians are required to sign their child into their program upon arrival. During orientation/gradual entry staff will
inform you of where the sign in/attendance sheets are located.

If your child will be late or absent please contact you’re the centre at 778-331-5532. If you are going to be away for a length of
time for example: vacation, medical reasons please inform the staff of this as well.

Children who are not well enough to participate in the normal RBA Child Care program including outside play or have an
infectious illness’ (see health and illness page), they must not be brought to the centre. It is important to let the staff know if your child is away due to an illness as it will assist in the monitoring and prevention of more serious illness.

## Section Seven

### Health and Illness Policies

We realize it is an inconvenience for working parents when we send sick children home; however, it is important to note that we
are required to do so by the Child Care Licensing Regulations as well as our own centre policies. Our main goal in doing so is to
try and minimize illness from spreading among the children and staff; thereby potentially impacting the centre’s operations. To
protect the wellbeing of the children in the program as well as the teachers who work with the children, sick children must not
come to child care.

RBA Child Care Staff are trained to recognize symptoms of illness and care for children who are ill. If a child shows signs or
symptoms of an illness staff will monitor the symptoms and take the child’s temperature when necessary. If the child has a
temperature, displays any of the other symptoms below or is unable to participate in the regular daily activities a staff member
will contact the parent/guardian to arrange for him/her to be picked up right away. Sick children may not remain in child care.

**In certain situations, we may ask you to provide a note from a physician to confirm your child is well enough to return
to a group child care setting.**

Whenever your child is ill and won’t be coming to child care, please call RBA Child Care to let us know that he/she will be absent.
Our telephone number is 778-331-5532.

**Children with the following symptoms may NOT attend child care**

* fever over 100.4 F/38C degrees in the last 24 hours
* nausea, vomiting and/or diarrhea in the last 24-48 hours
* unusual, unexplained loss of appetite, fatigue, irritability, or headache
* eye infections
* rash with fever
* difficulty breathing, wheezing or persistent cough
* known or suspected communicable diseases (measles, chicken pox etc)
* ear infection
* severe cold and/or cough and/or excessive runny nose that is coloured (i.e. green)
* sore throat

**Parents are advised that the RBA Child Care Program may modify the Health and Illness policy as required in order to
address emerging health issues that are prevalent within the community. We ask for parents support as we strive to
maintain a healthy environment for the children in our care as well as our teaching team.**

#### Medication

RBA Child Care staff cannot administer medication without the proper information and consent. Acceptable directions are a label
on a prescription drug bottle or a written letter from a physician including child’s full name, medication dose, and frequency or
medication to be administered, and any special precautions. **We require a medication consent form from the Fraser Health Authority to be completed by the parent for all types of medication that are to be administered while a child is in care.**

Where possible, antibiotics and other medications should be scheduled so that doses are due during hours when the child is at
home. When children are so ill as to require frequent medication, they probably shouldn’t be in child care for a full day.

**Under NO circumstances is medication to simply be left in a child’s bag or cubby. It must always be personally
delivered to a staff member who works in the child’s classroom who will then place it in a locking storage container.**

## Section Eight

### Creating a Safe, Secure and Engaging Environment

#### Child Guidance Policy

At the RBA Child Care Program, we work to establish safe, warm, and caring environments within which we teach children
positive and age appropriate ways to handle situations, to develop a strong sense of self-discipline, responsibility and courtesy
and to develop an atmosphere that is peaceful.

Challenging behaviour is addressed through a range of age appropriate methods. All Child Care employees in the program work
closely together to ensure the approach to guidance and discipline is applied in a caring and consistent manner. We follow an
approach that is based on empowerment, mutual respect, trust and natural consequences.

If a child consciously or frequently violates the social contract regarding safety, kindness and courtesy, our response is to identify
the appropriate and natural consequences of their actions.

#### Peaceful Environment

We promote a peaceful and harmonious environment for the benefit of all of our children and families.

We don’t allow super hero play or the use of violent/rude language or actions or loud angry voices. We encourage all of our
children to use peaceful (age appropriate) methods to solve disputes. For our older children we encourage them to use “their
words” to solve problems. You can support this at home by helping your child to talk problems through and using natural
consequences that are age appropriate.

We expect all adults who enter our facility (parents, guests, practicum students, visitors etc) to support maintaining our peaceful
environment.

#### Active Play Policy

At RB Child Care, we promote healthy active play for all children throughout the day, inside and outside, for a minimum of one
hour. Active play is an important part of early childhood growth and development. What does active play mean? Active play is
any activity that gets the body moving and increases breathing and heart rate. Keeping the ages and needs of the children in
mind here are a few examples of what active play looks like. This includes activities such as climbing, ball play, running games,
Go, Go, Stop and Duck, Duck, Goose. For younger infants and toddlers, it consists of tummy time, crawling, stair practice
dancing to music and much more.

#### Screen Time Policy

We do not offer any screen time unless it is for research based on the interests of children. Our screen time would be at the most
60 minutes per month. The RB Kids tablet/computer is used with the assistance of a teacher to research topics the children are
interested in.

#### Secure Facility Entrances & Security Passes

The RBA Child Care Program is a secure setting. All of the entrances to the facility operate with a security pass. We provide two
security passes for each family who are enrolled in the program. These passes work on the external main doors of the child
care. Access to the centre is available Monday to Friday from 7:30 AM to 5:35 PM. You are responsible for the passes that are
assigned to your family and will be charged a replacement cost if either of them are lost or misplaced. Please keep in mind that
these passes are designed to offer us increased safety and security within the centre. Given this, please do not lend your pass
to someone who only picks up your child on occasion. Should you lose your pass, please notify us immediately so that we can
have it disabled and arrange for a replacement pass

#### Emergency Procedures

The RBA Child Care Program strives to create an environment for young children that is as safe as possible during an
emergency or disaster situation. Our Emergency & Disaster Planning Policy includes procedures related to:

* Earthquakes
* Fire or Explosion
* Gas Leaks
* Bomb Threats
* Intruders

We practice monthly emergency drills in all of our classrooms and keep records related to those drills as required by Fraser
Health.

Parents are advised that the child care is stocked with emergency kits that include water, food and safety supplies. These kits
are accessible within the child care. In addition, the RBA building has other types of emergency supplies that are also available.
We also do co-ordinate our emergency planning, drill and evacuation efforts with the RBA Health & Safety Committee.

In the event that we must leave the child care facility due to an emergency evacuation, parents are advised of the following:

* The child care has an emergency marshalling area that we will gather at that is located outside of the facility. Please
  refer to the photo below to see the location that the child care evacuates to. In the event that we must relocate the
  children and teachers to another location (if the emergency marshalling area is deemed to be unsafe); this decision will
  be made by the RBA Child Care Director or other Senior Child Care Administrative Personnel. Parents are reminded
  that children may not be able to be immediately released from the emergency marshalling area until all children and
  teachers have been accounted for and the appropriate approvals for child releases have been met.

In the case of other types of emergencies, we follow the procedures outlined in our Emergency & Disaster Planning policy. We
also coordinate our efforts with the RBA Emergency Procedures for the Glenlyon Building as well as the Crisis Communications
Plan for RBA.

If you have questions about the Emergency Procedures please feel free to contact the child care office at 778-331-5532.

## Section Nine

### Connecting with the Community

#### Field trip/Out trips

On occasion, the older children in RBA Child Care may take field trips to local points of interest during the year. Each
fieldtrip/outing is planned to enhance the learning experience of the children in regards to subjects being studied or to take
advantage of special community events. A special notice of upcoming events will be sent home in prior to the field trip date.

In order to provide field trip opportunities RBA Child Care may ask for volunteer drivers to transport children to and from the
fieldtrip destinations or we may use other forms of transportation (bus, van, walking etc). We may request an additional fee to
help cover the costs for these outings.

#### Support of the Outside Community

In connection with our learning we will often select particular charities, community events or initiatives for our child care to
support. Examples of this include – raising funds for the Canadian Cancer Society, collecting food for the local food bank, etc. We hope you will support these initiatives, where possible, as we feel that they raise our child’s local and global awareness
regarding important social issues.
