If you are an employee of Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers you qualify to receive priority access to the RB Kids Child Care Program for you immediate children. Please contact the child care office at 778-331-5532  . We suggest that you contact us as far in advance as possible from when you think you will need that child care.

2. Siblings of RBA children already enrolled in the program.
3. Children of RBA employees.
4. Non RBA children already enrolled in the program that are moving to another room.
5. Siblings of Non RBA children already enrolled in the program.
