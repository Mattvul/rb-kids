If you are an employee of Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers you qualify to receive priority access to the RB Kids Child Care Program for your immediate children. Please contact the child care office at 778-331-5532  . We suggest that you contact us as far in advance as possible from when you think you will need that child care. The program is increasingly popular among employees and our space limitations are increasing.

**Admissions to the program are completed in the following priority order:**

1. Rba children already enrolled in the program that are moving to another room.
2. Siblings of RBA children already enrolled in the program.
3. Children of RBA employees.
4. Non RBA children already enrolled in the program that are moving to another room.
5. Siblings of Non RBA children already enrolled in the program.
6. Children of employees whose employer has a child care business partnership with Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers.
7. Children of people working in the Glenlyon Business Park Area
8. Children from the community.
