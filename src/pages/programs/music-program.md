Ms. Jasmine provides the children who are 3 and older with group piano lessons each week. In our Infant & Toddler program music program the children begin to discover instruments and music through music stories, rhymes and games. 

In our music classes, we teach young children the foundation of music education and piano playing in a group situation.We provide age-appropriate activities to help develop not only young childrenâ€™s ability to play and read music, but also cognitive, physical and social skills.
