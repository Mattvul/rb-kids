In our music program the children begin to discover instruments and music through music stories, rhymes and games.

We teach young children the foundation of music education and piano playing in a group environment. We provide age-appropriate activities to help develop not only young childrenâ€™s ability to play and read music, but also cognitive, physical and social skills.
