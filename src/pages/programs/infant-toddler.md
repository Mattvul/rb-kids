### Separation Anxiety in Young Children

Separation anxiety varies widely between children. Some babies become very upset when mom/dad is out of sight for a very short time, while other children seem to demonstrate on going anxiety at separations during infancy, toddlerhood, and preschool.  Some children seem to enter into the program with no separation anxiety at all and then develop it later .

### Helpful  Tips for Coping with Separation Anxiety

Create quick good-bye rituals – Keep the good bye short and sweet. If you stay the more difficult the transition time is. Create something you do that is special when saying good bye such as a high five or giving a stuffed toy/ blanket for comfort.

Be consistent – Try to drop off at the same time with the same ritual, whether it be a special hug or a soft blanket, some thing to keep with them during the day that is special to them

Attention – When saying good bye to your child make sure that you give them your full attention, be joyful, loving and reassuring.
