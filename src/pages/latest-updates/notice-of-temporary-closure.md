As the global effect of COVID19 continues to evolve, RB Child Care remains committed to the health & wellbeing of our children, families & staff. As a result of the continued threat of COVID19, we will not be reopening on March 30th. RB Child Care will be closed until further notice. We know the only way to stop this virus is to distance ourselves from others, and while we all desperately want to be back, we must follow these instructions to keep everyone healthy!



We are closely monitoring the situation and will keep you updated as to when we will be operational again. We are hopeful this will be within the next 3 to 4 weeks. We look forward to welcoming all of you back to RB Childcare when it is safe to do so. Please do not hesitate to reach out to me if you have any questions or concerns.
