**Communicable Disease Prevention Plan** 
\
**Covid-19 Specific**   

_\*Updated March 30, 2022\*_ 

The management of COVID-19 in the community is now more aligned with the management of other respiratory infections. Childcare staff or children who are exposed to COVID-19 may continue to attend childcare, regardless of vaccination status, unless they develop symptoms and/or test positive for COVID-19. If they develop symptoms of COVID-19 or test positive for COVID-19, they will need to follow the directions in the “What to do When Sick” section of the BCCDC website and follow the Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers Childcare Health & Illness Policy. 

If we are experiencing illness amongst staff, we may need to close for operational reasons if we are unable to maintain staff to child ratios as required under the Child Care Licensing Regulation.



In addition to the RB Kids Parent Policies and Procedures, which can be found at www.rbkids.ca, the following policies and procedures are effective immediately. These policies and procedures may change at any time due to the current Covid-19 situation.

****

**Health Awareness**

Staff and parents should regularly check to ensure that they (or their child) are not experiencing any symptoms of illness (including but not limited to COVID-19 symptoms) before coming to childcare to prevent the spread of communicable diseases, such as COVID-19, within the childcare settings.

****

**What to Do When Sick:**

Staff, children, or other persons in the childcare setting who are exhibiting symptoms of illness (including but not limited to COVID-19) should stay home until they are well enough to participate in all activities. Please refer to The When to Get Tested for COVID-19 resource or the B.C. Self-Assessment Tool for more information on whether you should get tested for COVID-19.

• Any child exhibiting symptoms must remain home until their symptoms have resolved and are well enough to participate in all aspects of the program. In some cases, children will need to remain at home and symptom-free for 48 hours before returning to childcare. This includes vomiting, diarrhea, and nausea.

* Please refer to our Health & Illness Policy on our website for further information regarding other childhood illnesses.

• Any child with a fever needs to remain home until they have been fever-free for 48 hours without the aid of fever-reducing medication.

• Staff, children, or other visitors can attend childcare if their symptoms are consistent with a previously diagnosed health condition (e.g., seasonal allergies)

* In some cases, a doctor's note may be required

Staff, children, or other people in the childcare setting who test positive for COVID-19 should follow the guidance on the BCCDC website as to how long they should self-isolate. They can return to childcare when they no longer need to self-isolate and meet the other requirements of our health & illness policy.

Please notify the Director of the childcare if your child or anyone in the child’s immediate household tests positive for Covid-19.



The following information has been taken from the BCCDC website (March 22/2022):

If you tested positive and are managing your illness at home, you can end isolation when all three of these conditions are met:

1. At least 5 days have passed since your symptoms started, or from the test date, if you did not have symptoms.

2. Fever has resolved without the use of fever-reducing medication, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen.

3. Symptoms have improved.

Fully vaccinated means you received both doses of a 2-dose series (e.g., AstraZeneca, Pfizer, or Moderna vaccine) or it has been more than 14 days since you received a single dose of a 1-dose series (e.g., Janssen/ Johnson and Johnson).

**Hand Hygiene**

Rigorous handwashing with plain soap and water is the single most effective way to reduce the spread of illness. Children and staff can pick up germs easily from anything they touch and can spread those germs to objects, surfaces, food, and people. Everyone should practice diligent hand hygiene. Parents and staff can teach and reinforce these practices amongst children. It is particularly important for hand hygiene to be practiced immediately before eating and immediately after using the toilet.

In addition to our hand washing policy in place - Children and staff will be asked to wash their hands according to the B.C Centre Disease Control recommendations:

• Upon arrival at childcare

• Before eating and drinking

• Before and after outdoor play

• After sneezing, coughing, or blowing their nose

• Before and after assisting children with food items and drinks

Parents are encouraged to use hand sanitizer when entering childcare. The sanitizer is located at the entrances to the childcare.

****

**Non-Medical Masks/Face Coverings**

Staff, parents, and visitors are required to wear masks at all times while inside the childcare. Masks are not required outside in the playground, as long as physical distancing can be maintained. This includes drop-off and pick-up outside.\
