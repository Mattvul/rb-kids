  ### Montessori:

The Montessori method provides a stimulating environment, which helps to prepare the child for future learning and living. The Montessori environment provides a balance of individual and group work, challenge and support, free choice and appropriate limits, independence and collaboration. It takes the whole child into consideration and helps the child move towards a real joy of learning and living.

### Reggio:

The Reggio Emilia Philosophy is an approach to teaching, learning and advocacy for children. In its most basic form, it is a way of observing what children know, are curious about and what challenges them. Teachers record these observations to reflect on developmentally appropriate ways to help children expand their academic and social potentials. Long term projects connect core academic areas in and out of the classroom.

### Traditional ECE:

Is a play based learning approach. Purposeful play is developmentally appropriate and significant element of any early childhood program.  The ECE philosophy emphasizes the importance of play in a child’s intellectual, social, emotional and physical development. Play is a way of learning for children. During a typical preschool day there will be structured and unstructured periods
