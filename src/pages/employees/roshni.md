Hello Everyone! My name is Roshni and I am really excited to join the RB Kids family. I have been in the childcare field for over 8 years. I started off by volunteering at childcare centers, I found I really enjoyed it and decided to get my Early Childhood Education Certificate. I have been working at ECE Educator for over 20 years now and I am really excited to meet everyone.
