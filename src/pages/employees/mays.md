I’m a computer engineer and mother of two; I have three years of experience working in Child Protection in various NGOs in Syria. When I came to Canada, I decided to support my practical experience with a degree that allowed me to work with children, so I became an Infant and Toddler Early Childhood Educator. 

I‘ve been working in this field for two years. I enjoy working with children, and I believe that children are full of potential, and they can show us other aspects of life that we adults have lost the ability to see and enjoy. Watching children grow, learn and develop through play is the most rewarding experience for me

I was also active in many humanitarian organizations in my community. I was a leader in Aleppo Girl Scouts/Forth Troop for 18 years and a leader in Girl Guides of Canada for two years, inspiring youth girls to improve their leadership skills.
