Hi, my name is Archuna, I am very excited to be working here with RB Childcare team. I graduated from Vancouver Career College with a certificate in Early Childhood Education. I believe that it is important for children to have a learning environment that is child-directed and free to explore. I am very happy to support RB Kids Childcareâ€™s philosophy and have fun with the children.
