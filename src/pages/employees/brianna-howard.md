Hi, my name is Brianna and I am really pleased to be apart of the infant and toddler team. I have been working in the Early Childhood Education field since 2007. Over the years I have had the privilege of working with 3-5-year-olds and over the last 6 years working with infant and toddlers. I am looking forward to helping your children grow and learn in a caring environment.
