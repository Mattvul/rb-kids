Hi, my name is Sujeong. I love working with children and watching them grow, create, explore and learn. This passion has inspired me to take the Early Childhood Education program and become an Early Childhood Educator. I have completed my I/T certification and I am looking forward to getting to know all the families at Rb Kids.
