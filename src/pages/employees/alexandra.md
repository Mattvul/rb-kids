Hi there! My name is Alexandra, and I am so excited to be joining the RB Kids team. I have been working with children since 2017, largely in a recreation and fine arts setting. I am looking forward to helping foster your child’s growth with the skills I’ve gained, by bringing them to the caring and compassionate environment that RBKids provides.
