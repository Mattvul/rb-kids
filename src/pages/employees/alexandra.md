Hi there! My name is Lari, and I am so excited to be a member of the RB Kids team. I am looking forward to helping foster your child's growth with the skills I have gained by bringing them to the caring and compassionate environment that RBKids provides. After completing my degree in Early Childhood Education in 2007, I started working with children and their families in preschool settings. One of the teaching philosophies that resonated with me was the Montessori approach, and I became curious about how educators and adults can guide the child. In 2018, I wrapped up my master's degree in education along with my Montessori training. My training has helped me understand how children develop and how to meet their needs. I am looking forward to the partnership of home and Rb kids that will help children discover themselves.
