Hi, my name is Jenny. I am an ECE, SN & I/T Educator. I graduated in 2011 from Vancouver Career College. I am a mother of a 10-year-old. Over the years I have gained valuable experience and was given the opportunity to work with a variety of children of many ages. I like to sing and play music. I love to bring my enthusiasm, love, and professional skill to support early learning. Now I am really happy to work with the children, parents and all the staff at Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers Child care as an Infant and Toddler Educator.
