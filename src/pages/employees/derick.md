Hello, my name is Derick. I'm a recent graduate from the Early Childhood and Care Education Assistant Plus Program at the Vancouver Community College. Previously coming from a background in theatre and helping with children's theatre camps growing up. I am delighted to inspire the children to become the best that they can be with such a strong, inspiring, and dynamic team here at Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers Childcare Center
